# kurohyou2
Some scripts made to help the Kurohyou 2 fansub team.

* `[kseq|globals]_extract.py <SEQfile>.pack`: extract texts from the KSEQ files of an ELPK and puts it in a .csv
* `[kseq|globals]_update.py <SEQfile>.pack`: updates `<SEQfile>.pack` with the sentences from `<SEQfile>.pack.csv` (which must be in the same directory) and puts the result in `<SEQfile>.pack.out`
